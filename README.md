User Security Actions

This app is an exercise for myself to get more experience with C# while also working with APIs.  I have some experience with Microsofot Graph, and so I thought I would start there.  You can use this app to pick out a user and then perform various actions on that user.

You can reset their password, view their authentication methods, disable/enable the user, remove any authentication methods, add various different methods, and some additional features.
